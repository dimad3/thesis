        /* The header() function sends a raw HTTP header to a client.
        Basically, HTTP functions allow you to manipulate information sent to the browser 
        by the webserver before any other output has been sent.
        It must be called before sending any actual output, either by normal HTML tags, 
        blank lines in a file or from a PHP file.
        Parameter Values:
        1) header	Required. This parameter hold the header string. There are two types of header calls. 
        The first header starts with string “HTTP/”, which is used to figure out 
        the HTTP status code to send. The second case of header is the “Location:”.
        2) replace	Optional. Indicates whether the header should replace a previous 
        similar header or add a new header of the same type.
        Default is TRUE (will replace). FALSE allows multiple headers of the same type
        3) http_response_code	Optional. Forces the HTTP response code to the specified value
        Return Value:	Nothing
